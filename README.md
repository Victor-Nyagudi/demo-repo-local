# Demo Repository From My Pc

#### Inclusive of more markdown practice

I've just seen how to start a repo from github.com. Now, I'm looking at how to do it from my local computer.
Again, I'm going to use some **_markdown_** for practice. So far, I've learned:

1. About SSH keys and why you need them to connect to your github account
  * These also have a passphrase as an extra layer of securiy in case someone gets access to your computer.
It's not _exactly_ necessary, but it's not bad to have one :smile:.
2. A couple of git commands such as `add`, `status`, `commit`, `push`, and `ls-files`.
3. When you change a file, it gets a capital "M" on the left panel in VS Code to mean it's been modified. If you
create a new file in the folder, it gets a "U" to mean it's untracked. You'll have to use `git add .` to tell git to track them. 
4. When using `git add`, the period means to track all the files in the directory. You can optionally just type the name of the file itself.
5. Finally, when you use `git commit -m "Meaningful message here" -m "Longer description here"`, you should supply a meaningful message after the first "-m" which will populate the title bit of the commit. To add a longer description, you can optionally add another "-m" then explain what you need to explain.

It's not much, but I'm making progress. _Slow motion is better than no motion. Keep going!_
